Two types of Memory on board the K70 microcontroller
	1. RAM - random access memory -> static RAM -> made up of flip-flops and does not need to be refreshed. RAM can be read and written to at any time - it is the place where variables are stored, as well as the stack and the heap.//not used.

	2. NVM - non-volatile memory -> Is based on Flash technology. Flash is a memory technology that allows for bulk erasure, random writing, fast read access, and dense implementation (small silicon area). 

There are 2 styles of FlaSh memory used in K70 family of MCUs.
	1. Program Flash Memory -> consists of large blocks of memory - it normally holds the program code and constants.
	2. FlexNVM -> this memory has the capability to emulate electrically erasable programmable read only memory (EEPROM) 

In the Tower Board MCU MK70FN1M0VMJ12 -> We only have "Program Flash Memory" -> we will store our non-volatile variables in a flash block that we know will not be used by our program (our program is small so it leaves plenty of "Program Flash" available for data)

The flash can be read just like normal RAM - no specified procedures is needed. However unlike RAM, when writing to the FLASH a special procedure is required.

//Writing to the flash
Some of the tasks needed to write to the memory are:
	1.applying high programming voltage to a particular row
	2. selecting  particular cell
	3. pulsing the memory etc
All these tasks are carried out by an on-chip state machine that hides the complexity of this writing process.

All we have to do is interact with a few control registers to be able to write to the flash.

//COMMAND INTERFACE

FSTAT -> Flash Status -> status register to indicate the state-machine status

FCNFG -> Flash Configuration-> a configuration register used to allow interrupts to be generated under certain conditions.

FSEC -> Flash Security -> a read only security register used to indicate the state of the built-in security features such as 						mass erase enable/disable

FOPT -> Flash Option -> a read only register used to indicate the flash options applied at boot time, such as whether to 						boot into low-power mode.

FCCOB0 -> Flash common command object registers -> B- twelve registers that hold the flash interface's command, address, 						data and other parameters associated with a particular Flash Operation.

<-------A complete description of the Flash memory module can be found in Chapter 30 of Freescaleâ€™s K70 Sub-Family Reference Manual.--------->

All K70 parts have "PROGRAM FLASH MEMORY" in the range 0X0000_0000 -> 0X0007_FFFF.
Memory starting address 0x0000_0000 -> Block 0 -> "vector table" that is used by NVIC (Nested Vectored Interrupt Controller) to get the initial stack pointer, initial program counter, and interrupt service routine addresses.

We have chosen flash Block2 in thw other "bank" to store our non-volatile data.

Inside each block the Flash Memory is further divided into SECTORS, which is the smallest unit that can be earased. 

One aspct of Flash technology that should be remembered is that it must be ERASED before it is written to. FAILURE TO DO SO MAY DAMAGE THE FLASH ARRAY.
